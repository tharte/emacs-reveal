;;; Commentary:
;; This file contains setup code to publish reveal.js presentations
;; from Org source files with emacs-reveal.
;;
;; After loading this file, the standard Org export function
;; `org-publish-all' publishes all projects added by code below to
;; `org-publish-project-alist'.  Org source files (except explicitly
;; excluded ones) are published according to
;; `emacs-reveal-publish-org-publishing-functions'.  The target
;; directory is "public".  Besides, reveal.js resources are copied to
;; "public".
;;
;; If file "index.org" is present in the current directory (e.g., to
;; collect links to generated reveal.js presentations), it is added to
;; `org-publish-project-alist' for export to HTML (with the standard
;; HTML export back-end).  HTML export is modified by
;; `emacs-reveal-publish-html-doctype' and
;; `emacs-reveal-publish-html-postamble'.
;; If existing, file "index.css" and directories among "audio",
;; "figures", "quizzes" are added to `org-publish-project-alist'
;; for export as attachment (copy).
;;
;; You may want to load/require this file from your own publish.el
;; with additional entries added to `org-publish-project-alist'.
;; Then, invoke publication based on your own publish.el:
;; emacs --batch --load publish.el --funcall org-publish-all
;;
;; Warning! By default, code below sets `org-confirm-babel-evaluate'
;; to `emacs-reveal-publish-confirm-evaluate', which defaults to nil.
;; This enables automatic execution of code embedded in Org source
;; files.  This may be dangerous, and I do *not* recommend this for
;; general Emacs sessions.  Set
;; `emacs-reveal-publish-confirm-evaluate' to t to be asked for
;; confirmation.
;;
;; Inspired by publish.el by Rasmus:
;; https://gitlab.com/pages/org-mode/blob/master/publish.el
